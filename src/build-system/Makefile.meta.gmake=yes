# Work around GNU Make's tendency to double its automatic
# --jobserver-fds=* flag's usage with each level of recursion, by
# constructing an alternate MFLAGS_NR variable that limits its
# occurrence to a single instance.  (Stripping it altogether backfires
# with the patched make Mac OS X 10.5 ships.)

MFLAGS_NR = $(filter-out --jobserver-fds=%,$(MFLAGS)) $(word 1,$(filter --jobserver-fds=%,$(MFLAGS)))
